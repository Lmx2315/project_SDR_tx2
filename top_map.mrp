  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Pack:1653 - At least one timing constraint is impossible to meet because component delays alone exceed the constraint. A timing
   constraint summary below shows the failing constraints (preceded with an Asterisk (*)). Please use the Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE
   (command line) with the Mapped NCD and PCF files to identify which constraints and paths are failing because of the component delays
   alone. If the failing path(s) is mapped to Xilinx components as expected, consider relaxing the constraint. If it is not mapped to
   components as expected, re-evaluate your HDL and how synthesis is optimizing the path. To allow the tools to bypass this error, set the
   environment variable XIL_TIMING_ALLOW_IMPOSSIBLE to 1.


   For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing Analyzer Reference manual; for more information on TRCE,
   consult the Xilinx Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net upr_at45db321_1/reg_fifo_rd
   is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the
   CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network sram_d<15>_IBUF has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 70 more times for the

   dds_mod_fm/sine<3>
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
INFO:Pack:1650 - Map created a placed design.
INFO:PhysDesignRules:1861 - To achieve optimal frequency synthesis performance

   consult the device Data Sheet.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 372 block(s) removed
  40 block(s) optimized away
 439 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
